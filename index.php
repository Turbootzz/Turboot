        <p class="banner-1-text">My name is Thijs Herman, and I am a web developer.
          I've made many projects that can be useful for me or for other people. I am always trying to push
          myself and make new discoveries of the things I can build or make. Most of my projects are
          open-source and can be found on my Github page.

    <h1>How did I start?</h1>
    <hr class="hr line-1" />
    <p class="banner-2-text">I've always had interest in doing technical things since I was young.
      It all started when I was 11 years old and I got my dads old PC and I was really into Minecraft
      at the time. So I started a Minecraft server and eventually I started to make Java plugins for it.
      <br><br>When I finished highschool I chose a study for IT network administrator but I didn't really
      like how they were teaching it to us, so I stopped and a year later I started a study for web development.
      <br><br>I've also built my own server where I host multiple VMs (see Server Hosting). I still have a lot to learn
      but I am always striving to be better.
